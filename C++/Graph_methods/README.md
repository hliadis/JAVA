This project (all methods are included in the Graph.hpp file) implements various Graph functions (create graph, add vertex/edge, delete vertex/edge, find vertex/edge, vertex mapping) as well as various algorithms (DFS and BFS traversal, Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree, Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford's single source shortest path algorithm)
